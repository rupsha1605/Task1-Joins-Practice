Task 1: Joins Practice

Description:

This task demonstrates the use of SQL `JOIN` operations including:

- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` *(using UNION in MySQL)*

Two sample tables were used:
- `Customers`
- `Orders`

Files:
- `Task1-Joins.sql` – SQL script to create tables, insert data, and perform joins

Real-World Use Cases for Each JOIN

INNER JOIN:  To list all customers **who have placed orders** — combining only matching records.         
LEFT JOIN:  To show **all customers**, including those who **haven’t placed any orders** yet.           
RIGHT JOIN:  To show **all orders**, including those **without matching customers** (e.g., guest orders).
FULL JOIN:  To list **all customers and all orders**, matched or not — for full visibility and auditing.

Tools Used:
- MySQL Command Line Client
- Notepad
